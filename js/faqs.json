If a student fails a course, a make-up exam will be held shortly after the end-semester exams to provide another chance to pass the exam. In the make-up exam, a ceiling is kept on the grade so that the student does not get more than DD.
</p>
<p>

 If a student fails the make-up exam as well, he/she will have to take up the course again, either in the summer or in subsequent semesters. Maintaining attendance greater than 75% in each course is necessary to avoid getting an FA grade (Fail due to lack of attendance).  
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

The grading system in NITK is relative.The department which is offering the course decides the range of marks for a particular grade. You can get the following grades in a subject- 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

AA – 10.
</p>
<p>

AB – 9. 
</p>
<p>

BB – 8. 
</p>
<p>

BC – 7. 
</p>
<p>

CC – 6. 
</p>
<p>

CD – 5. 
</p>
<p>

DD – 4. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

If the grade point is below 4, the respective student is declared failed in that particular subject.

Ever bored of dreary-old freshman year? (Is that even a question?). Well, this place is the solution. Head over with a mate to enjoy a refreshing game of badminton. This place also has tables for table tennis. Though equipments are provided here, it’s advisable to carry your own because they are usually understocked. There are three badminton courts and it’s pretty tough to get a spot on weekdays due to the huge crowd. Though it has a fixed time slot, it is generally open most of the time (read : whenever the caretaker’s around). Also, you can borrow other equipment like football cones, cricket stumps and shuttlecocks to name a few. Keep in mind that you’ll have to borrow these by depositing your ID card with the caretaker which will be returned once the equipment is returned and this issuing happens only till 6:30 P.M.

		"answer": `<p>

Before you know it, the mess food would have become a bore, and breakfast will be a long forgotten meal. As a relief from the constant hunger pangs that you will bring upon yourself by missing meals, there are quite a few small and decent food joints in the campus, where new alliances and friendships are forged and long lost friends are found.

</p>
<p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">AMUL</span> </strong>
</p>
<p>

Hungry? Want a snack?  
</p>
<p>

It’s simple, go to Amul. Amul is a small but well-endowed store situated right next to the Sports Complex and is an important landmark on campus. It is very close to the boy’s hostels and hence very convenient for boys.  
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

The girls, on the other hand, have to walk a bit to get there, but there are ‘Nandini’, Reddy’s and ‘Fresh and Honest’ stores near and around the girl's hostel too.
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

<strong>What's exclusive? </strong>
</p>
<p>

You can find a plethora of snacks and drinks to choose from. 
</p>
<p>

From Gatorade to the infamous Sip-On, you can get all kinds of energy drinks, cold drinks, various Fruit Juices, Amul milkshakes and bottled water to go. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

Hot stuff? You get samosas and veg/paneer puffs. These might even become part of your staple diet if you develop hatred towards mess food. Other than that you get the usual biscuits, Lays, Kurkure, and their kin. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

You get ice cream here as well.  
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

You can also get your cell phone recharge done here (almost all major carriers).

The Night Canteens open at 7:00 pm and it’s open all the way up to two-three in the morning. They start taking orders from around 7:15-7:30 pm.

</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

Their menus are self explanatory and the food is all reasonably priced. The taste is good enough for the price we pay.

</p>

<p>

The Girls block has one Night Canteen which is open from 7:30 pm to 2:00 am on all days except when there is grand dinner (which is once a month). You will find yourself crashing in here very often once your taste buds get bored of the monotonous mess food.

The most popular on the menu would be their dosas. You will always find a rush near the dosa counter.
</p>
<p>

The other "in demand" items are parathas, Oreo shake, cold coffee, juices, ice candies, and ice creams. You also get non-veg here so if you are an avid meat-eater and in the GH mess, this place is your savior. 
</p>
<p>
 
</p>
<p>

They take orders as well. The ordering procedure for boys is the same as it is for the Boys' Block NC. For girls, you can place your order and they will call you once it's ready. So you can go collect your parcels from NC.  
</p>
<p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">OCEAN PEARL / FOOD COURT</span> </strong>

And like most of South India, NITK too has its own bakery, right below the Students’ cooperative. From fresh juices to egg puffs, it reminds you of the bakery you went to, right after a tiring day at school.

Under relative grading, you'll be assessed based on the highest scorer of the class.
