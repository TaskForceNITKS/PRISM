		"The Student Council holds regular meets with the students to know the various issues faced by them and takes up the same with the authorities. Notable such steps taken last year include: setting up of Optional Mess system, increasing MACS and SOM electives for final years, issuing new ID cards, introducing bus services within the campus, etc.",
		"Procuring Xerox machines for both Girls and Boys hostels, opening of a new Canara Bank ATM near the Girls Block, improving the lighting and security with the campus are some other steps taken by the council during the previous year. During exams, the SC takes measures to introduce generators in the hostels for full time power backup. Timing of the Library and the Central Computing Centre are also extended to aid the students in their studies.",
