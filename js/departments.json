	"intro": "Chemical Engineers have the primary responsibility of using raw materials and turning them into products which can be used in day-to-day lives of the people. Several of these products are commodities obtained from oil and gas and all these products are made with the help of chemical processes which allow us to access them.",
	"definition": "Chemical Engineering, in principle, deals with the various physical and chemical processes that transpire in daily life, ranging from microscale to macroscale, and the understanding of these processes and how best to improve them, to suit the needs of the population. It is not to be confused with chemistry though as most students often do. Chemical Engineering is a huge and diverse branch. You'll be interested in building, designing and working of large industries and not so much about reactions/microscale details that happen inside (that is what Chemistry students concentrate about).",
	"course_information":"Well it involves a wide range of courses from heat transfer, mass transfer, momentum transfer, chemical reaction engineering, separation processes, process control, petroleum engineering, thermodynamics etc. Quite a few students also go for higher studies to specialize in the field they're most interested in. (Almost all of them are 2 semester courses)",

	"definition": "In a nutshell, this department studies the structure-property relations of metals and other materials. Basically, we look at the structure of the metal at the atomic scale (FCC, BCC, that sort of stuff), how the atoms are arranged and bonded, and use this information to figure out what the macroscopic properties of the metal/material should be. Metallurgy is at the intersection of Mechanical Engineering and Chemical Engineering, along with some other concepts as well. We need to understand how stresses/strains work and how they effect the structures of metals at the atomic scale and hence the macro properties. This is where the concepts of Mechanical Engineering come in. Some fields of metallurgy deal with the science of the flow and reactions of molten metal, and this is where Chemical Engineering is needed. Of course, extraction of metals from ores is another important field.",

Jobs can be obtained in industries such as SAIL, Tata Steel, etc. They can also be obtained in organisations such as DRDO, BARC, DMRL (Defence Metallurgical Research Laboratories), etc, although it is much easier to get such jobs with a Masters degree. Further studies can be pursued in India or abroad. Some of the finest work in India happens in universities such as IISc, Bengaluru and IIT Madras. BARC undertakes research and projects in the bleeding edge of metallurgy (dealing with the properties, modification and application of nuclear materials), and provides opportunities for students to obtain a Master's degree before starting their work. Alumni of NITK Metallurgy regularly go abroad for further studies. Some examples from the batches of 2016 and 2017 include Cornell, UCSD, Michigan State University, TU Delft, Chalmers University, EPFL, Erasmus Mundus (2 year funded programme in Europe), Polimi University and University of South Australia. After obtaining a Master's degree or even a PhD, you can get well-paying positions in academia or industry. Many metallurgists work as analytic consultants, performing failure analysis for industries.",

Courses like geology, development of mineral deposits, drilling and blasting, surveying, mining machinery are covered. The third year covers all the important courses a mining engineer must know. These include rock mechanics, mine environment engineering, surface mining, underground coal mining, mine power systems.
